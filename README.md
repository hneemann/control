# control #

Is a simple tool for teaching the basics of classic control theory.
It is intended to be used by the students to create Nyquist plots, 
Bode plots and root locus analysis plots (Evans plots). It is possible 
to simulate a linear system and to create a step response plot. 
It is also possible to calculate the response of a system to an arbitrary 
input signal.
It works on Android and iOS tablets, Windows, Linux and MacOS.
Although it is possible to run it on a smartphone, it is not a good 
platform for this app, because the screen is so small.
There is a [static web page](https://hneemann.github.io/control_static/) 
that can be used. But that static page does not allow storing scripts on 
the server. 

# Usage #

The help icon offers some examples and shows how to use it. Error messages
offer a description of the error and a hint how to fix it.

# Limits #

The simulation of linear systems is done by using the Euler method, with a 
fixed number of steps which is good enough for most simple cases, but not 
sufficient for simulating more complex systems.
