# control #

Is a simple engine to be used in teaching classic control theory.
It is intended to be hosted on a server and to be used by the students.
There is a [static web page](https://hneemann.github.io/control_static/) 
that can be used to run the engine in the browser.
But this version does not allow storing scripts. 

# Usage #

The help icon offers some examples and shows how to use it. Error messages
offer a description of the error and a hint how to fix it.

# Limits #

The simulation of linear systems is done by using the Euler method, with a 
fixed number of steps which is good enough for most simple cases, but not 
sufficient for simulating more complex systems.
